          <h2>Usefulness of cats</h2>
          <img src="assests/media/cat.jpg" alt="cat" />
          <p>
            In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In
            our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
            storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
            granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
            markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
            are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still
            they are of great service.
          </p>
          <p>
            How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
            awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is
            their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes
            this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
          </p>
          <p class="move">
            The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the
            mouse's hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp,
            resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one
            have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be
            delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting
            and kind regard for them.
